/**
 * In the proxy class above, we implemented the same ReportGenerator interface of ReportGeneratorImpl. 
 * This will allow our proxy to be used wherever a ReportGeneratorImpl object is expected. 
 * 
 * In Line 5, we declared a reference to the ReportGeneratorImpl object. 
 * By going with the principle of “Prefer composition over inheritance”, 
 * 我们声明了一个ReportGeneratorImpl对象的引用，根据“ 优先使用（对象）组合，而非（类）继承”的原则。
 * we me made our proxy composed of the real ReportGeneratorImpl object. 
 * We also declared a Role instance variables that we initialized through the constructor. 
 * But, we intentionally refrained from instantiating ReportGeneratorImpl in the constructor C 
 * we want to create it only when it is required. 
 * 
 * From Line 11 C Line 14, we implemented the displayReportTemplate() method. 
 * Again, what I want to point out is that if the client makes a request to display how a report looks like in a particular format (but, without any data), 
 * we don’t want to create the expensive ReportGeneratorImpl object just to display the template. 
 * 
 * It is only when the client calls generateComplexReport() that we wrote from Line 16 to Line 21, 
 * we create a ReportGeneratorImpl object and pass the method call to it. 
 * What we implemented is the functionality of a virtual proxy. 
 * 
 * From Line 22 to Line 33, 
 * we wrote the generateSesnsitiveReport() method to implement the functionality of a protection proxy. 
 * 
 * In this method, we checked the role name of aRole object that the proxy was initialized with. 
 * We allowed access to the ReportGeneratorImpl object only if the role name is Manager.
